My research broadly deals with the effect and timing of management practices on individuals, teams, and organizational outcomes. My dissertation examines the relationship between bonus pay and voluntary turnover. More specifically, I study the quit patterns surrounding bonus payment periods â€“ including the degree of clustering (i.e., when multiple employees leave within a short timespan) as well as the compositions of leavers (i.e., high vs. low performers). I also explore the exit reasons of leavers and conclude by estimating the financial and productivity consequences on the work units.
