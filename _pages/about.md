I am an assistant research professor with the Center for International Human Resource Studies in the School of Labor and Employment Relations at Penn State. My research examines the impact of HRM practices on individuals, teams, and organizational outcomes. Prior to joining Penn State, I received my Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and my Bachelor of Science in Psychology from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. Prior to academia, I also worked in HR recruitment and organizational development in Bangkok, Thailand.
