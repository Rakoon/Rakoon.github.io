I am an assistant research professor with the Center for International Human Resource Studies in the School of Labor and Employment Relations at Penn State. My research examines the impact of HRM practices on individuals, teams, and organizational outcomes. Prior to joining Penn State, I received my Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and my Bachelor of Science in Psychology from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. Prior to academia, I also worked in HR recruitment and organizational development in Bangkok, Thailand.

My research broadly deals with the effect and timing of management practices on individuals, teams, and organizational outcomes. My dissertation examines the relationship between bonus pay and voluntary turnover. More specifically, I study the quit patterns surrounding bonus payment periods â€“ including the degree of clustering (i.e., when multiple employees leave within a short timespan) as well as the compositions of leavers (i.e., high vs. low performers). I also explore the exit reasons of leavers and conclude by estimating the financial and productivity consequences on the work units.
