I am an assistant research professor in the School of Labor and Employment Relations at Penn State. My research focuses on the adoption and effect of Human Resource Management (HRM) practices on workers and organizations. My projects primarily cover practices relating to pay and turnover, though since joining Penn Stateâ€™s School of Labor Relations I have developed a nascent interest in studying union busting. I also work on team effectiveness where I consider the allocation of scarce talent and the nature of strategically core team roles. Additionally, I am affiliated with the Center for International Human Resource Studies where I help manage the [**CRANET**](https://cranet.la.psu.edu/) dataset along with organizing the biennial [**Global Conference on IHRM**](https://ler.la.psu.edu/cihrs/ihrmconference/). The next one will be held in **June 2024 in Gothenburg, Sweden**, so please consider submitting your abstracts!

Prior to joining Penn State, I received my Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and my Bachelor of Science in Psychology from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. Before academia, I also worked in HR recruitment and organizational development in Bangkok, Thailand.

Below are my research projects and their 1-sentence summaries.

## Strategic and International HRM
### Temporal Patterns of Collective Voluntary Turnover Surrounding Bonus Payments
-	People wait to collect their bonuses before quitting the company, so time your payments accordingly.
-	2021 Best Student Convention Paper Award - Academy of Management, HR Division

### Institutions, Economies, and Downsizing: Evidence across Time and Countries
- Institutional constraints imposed by employment laws may weaken during economic crises.

### Discharges, Poor-Performer Quits, and Layoffs as Valued Exits: Is It Really Addition by Subtraction?
-	Firing, poor-performer quitting, and layoffs are typically seen as beneficial for the company, but this may not necessarily be so. 

### Cultural Values as Predictors of Congruence between Employee and Supervisor HR Strength Perceptions
-	Cultural values like power distance, collectivism, and uncertainty avoidance can help predict when employees are more likely to see eye-to-eye with their supervisors regarding HR practices

### Turnover and its Anti-Unionization Effect
-	We tend to think of unions as reducing employee turnover, but turnover can also prevent unionization in the first place.

## Team Effectiveness
### Talent Dispersion within Teams
- Given limited resources, should you build a team with a star employee surrounded by less capable teammates or a team of moderately capable members?

### The Strategic Core Team Role: Emergence, Mechanisms, And Future Research Directions
- What exactly is the strategic core role, how does it comes about, and why does it affects team performance?

## Research Methods
### Mediation Research: Drawing Valid and Complete Inferences
- Mediation studies are too focused on the statistical significance of the indirect effect and often fail to consider its size relative to the direct or total effect.
