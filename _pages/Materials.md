Below are selected code and data from some of my research projects.

## Turnover Timing
- [**Stata** .do file for calculating turnover clustering / dispersion based on Call, Nyberg, Ployhart, & Weekley (2015 AMJ)](https://github.com/Rakoon/Replicate/blob/main/Turnover%20cluster%20%26%20dispersion%20Poisson%20measure.do)

## Talent Dispersion within Teams
- [**R** code for scraping NBA data at the *season* level.](https://github.com/Rakoon/Replicate/blob/main/NBA_SeasonLevel_DataScrape.R)
- [**R** code for scraping NBA data at the *game* level.](https://github.com/Rakoon/Replicate/blob/main/NBA_GameLevel_Data.R)

## Monte Carlo Simulation of Proportion Mediated (PM)
- [**R** code for simulating PM's statistical properties in consistent mediation cases.](https://github.com/Rakoon/Replicate/blob/main/PM%20Simulation%20-%20consistent%20x%20PM.R)
- [**R** code for simulating Absolute PM's statistical properties in consistent mediation cases.](https://github.com/Rakoon/Replicate/blob/main/PM%20Simulation%20-%20consistent%20x%20absPM.R)
- [**R** code for simulating Absolute PM's statistical properties in **IN**consistent mediation cases.](https://github.com/Rakoon/Replicate/blob/main/PM%20Simulation%20-%20inconsistent%20x%20absPM.R)
