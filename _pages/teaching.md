I consider teaching to be one of the most meaningful activity that I engage in. This is because teaching not only provides a platform for knowledge dissemination, but it also serves as a constant reminder to revaluate my own understanding of the world. While at Wisconsin, I taught the undergraduate introduction to management class and my work was recognized by the Wisconsin School of Business's teaching award. At Penn State, I taught research methology for both undergraduate and master's students.
