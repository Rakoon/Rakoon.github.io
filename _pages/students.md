## Current open project(s):
  - International HRM meta-database
    - We are creating a centralized resource for IHRM scholars to locate databases with pertinent key variables, access instructions, and works published using these data. Presently, we have examined 1,900+ research papers from leading international business and HRM journals and identified 169 unique datasets. The next step is to compile their metadata.
